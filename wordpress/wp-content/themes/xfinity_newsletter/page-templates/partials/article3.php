		<h4>This is what we work toward every day: new ways to use voice as a means to make homes smarter, safer, and easier to manage.</h4>
		<p>“Ok Google. Find a hotspot near me.”</p>
		<p>To fully engage and optimize voice technology, our services have to dovetail each other and operate as a collective whole. Conversations with our customers have to be fluid and natural, across products and platforms, from device to device. The goal is to create a seamless integration of services, an effortless connectivity that makes life easier for millions of customers. So how are we doing it? Digital First.</p>

			<p>Digital First is a shift in how we think about both the customer and employee experience. It’s geared towards providing customers autonomy while eliminating the need for assisted support. This transformational journey is based on a conversational UI that taps into our distinct brand personality.</p>
			
			<p>Let’s look at our buy flow as an example. We’re reimagining the end-to-end experience to feature a “Help Me Decide” format that makes it easier to personalize packages. Customers will be guided through decisions, offered assistance at key moments and given the ability to skim or dig into more detailed information at any time. The customer drives the experience, engaging directly in a friendly, personal way. Internet with a side of TV? Yes, please!</p>	

			<p>This conversational style instills trust in our customers by anticipating their needs and delivering on expectations without frustration. It’s this approach that’s given way to our emerging Virtual Assistant technology and a range of self-help features designed to educate, assist and resolve issues online in a manner that’s often more efficient than a direct call.</p>
			<p>The result? A new normal. Our customers are digital first, so we have to be too. Their lives and requests can be unpredictable and we have to design for the unexpected. If we can start the conversation online, in text, the evolution to voice will be an effortless transition.</p>
			<p>“Put on <i>Game of Thrones,</i> turn off the lights, and turn up the heat.”</p>
			<p class="highlight is-bold">With voice technology, the possibilities are endless and as unique as the individuals we’re speaking to.</p>
			<p>We imagine a time when we can serve dynamic ads to different users based on their voice ID. Why not show movie-buff Mom a new trailer instead of the computer that Junior’s been asking about? We’re prepping for the potential as well as the actual future of voice, one utterance at a time.</p>
			<p>As we extend our Digital First efforts to more customer touch points&mdash;including call centers, tech and retail&mdash;we’re now, more than ever, committed to delivering a best-in-class experience you have to say to believe. </p>
			<p>“Hey X1, show me more.”</p>
