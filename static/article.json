We’re a creative team of strategists, designers, writers and researchers who understand the potential behind every interaction and the impact of a first impression. Here’s a chance to get to know us better. Each quarter, this newsletter will spotlight the vision and passion of the people and projects that make up the Experience Design group. Today, we’re talking about voice technology and how we’re actually speaking with customers. We invite you to join the conversation, ask questions and let us know how we can partner with you in the future. It’s a new year packed with possibility. Welcome."

It’s a natural fit, one that allows our customers to become more comfortable with voice technology while putting us in the position to lead and differentiate. Since our customers offer the most valuable insights, we turn to research to reveal viable opportunities and primary&nbsp;challenges."

It’s the exciting, shiny object that allows companies to check the box and say, &quot;us too!&quot; And everyone seems to be using it to different ends. At one point, I was led into a booth by an Alexa app that turned out to be a showcase for HD Radio? Wait…What?! Not the payoff I was expecting."
