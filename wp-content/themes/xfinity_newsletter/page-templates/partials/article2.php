			<p>I’ve sat through enough research meetings to know just how important this is. While it’s a pain point for customers, most learn to live with sub-par performance or missed connections. What’s different and what I’ve seen this past year, is that companies are actually trying to solve these connectivity issues.</p>

			<p>They’re starting to ask the right questions and deliver solutions that make sense. It’s an approach that not only solidifies the customer relationship but also creates a foothold in the digital home.</p>
			<p>On our end, we announced the next level of hardware featuring a software platform that makes sense of network connections by humanizing the experience in a whole new way: The Advanced Wireless Gateway. With this release, we’ve given customers a better understanding of their equipment and their network. Customers can set up and connect devices, identify and resolve issues on their own, quickly, without a tech call. The result? It’s already surpassed all other 3rd party routers on the market.</p>
			<p>The move to humanize this device, and personalize the experience, helps our customers grow more comfortable, gain confidence and be more likely to embrace new technology like voice controls. They won’t just add hardware, but they’ll expand and improve connectivity throughout their entire home. By tackling the hardest problems, the most daunting technical and customer experience challenges, we have the opportunity to establish our own footprint in the emerging digital home.</p>
