				<p>As experience designers (XD), we approach e	very challenge as an opportunity, an occasion to connect with customers, make life easier and bring about more moments of pure delight. We’re a creative team of strategists, designers, writers and researchers who understand the potential behind every interaction and the impact of a first impression. Here’s a chance to get to know us better. Each quarter, this newsletter will spotlight the vision and passion of the people and projects that make up the Experience Design group. Today, we’re talking about voice technology and how we’re actually speaking with customers. We invite you to join the conversation, ask questions and let us know how we can partner with you in the future. It’s a new year packed with&nbsp;possibility.</p>
