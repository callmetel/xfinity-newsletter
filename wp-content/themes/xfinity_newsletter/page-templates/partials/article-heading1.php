				<p>Over the past few years, natural language processing has improved immensely, and as a result, people want to do more with voice control. Comcast has the distinct benefit of integrating voice with TV, a familiar device that’s already in most homes. It’s a natural fit, one that allows our customers to become more comfortable with voice technology while putting us in the position to lead and differentiate. Since our customers offer the most valuable insights, we turn to research to reveal viable opportunities and primary&nbsp;challenges.</p>
