		<p>As the list of voice-enabled devices grows, the segmentation among them can be clearly defined into three types of experiences:</p>

		<h3 class="is-bold">The End-to-End Assistant</h3>
		<p>An assistant that can handle whatever you throw at it. From asking random questions, ordering a pizza, or playing music, it delivers. Think Amazon Alexa, Cortana before it, Google Home and Viv just after.</p>
		
		<h3 class="is-bold">The Bespoke Assistant</h3>
		<p>This assistant speaks to an unmet niche of an audience. This might be an audio device that reads your children bedtime stories or a medical device that can assist with a diagnosis.</p>

			<h3 class="is-bold">The Integrated Device</h3>
			<p>This experience serves the dumb device, the one with a minimal interface that strives to be “smart”. Rather than completely rebuild, this device integrates with an existing assistant. Take the Whirlpool washing machine for instance. Want to know if the wash is done? Just ask Alexa.</p>
			<p>At Comcast, we’ve been focusing on voice technology for some time. From our first voice-enabled iOS app to the latest XR11. The question for us, and for many at CES, is what’s next?</p>
			<p>For our platform with XR18, it’s the hands-free conversational aspect of the experience. Previously, even though you could ask a question and get a response, you’d have to use your remote control to complete the task. Now the aim is to lose the remote altogether. We can’t do this by simply adding voice to an existing experience; the entire experience needs to be reimagined from the ground up. Today’s X1 was designed for a remote while tomorrow’s UI must be designed for voice first.</p>
			<p>Think about it. Today’s experiences are based on sound logic where users are guided through a pre-determined flow to get an expected result. Tomorrow’s interfaces will have to deal with the unpredictable. This is a conversation with our users that we haven’t had before, a conversation that’s no longer one way in nature. What we learn from customer conversations will inform how we react, what we suggest and ultimately, how well we meet their expectations.</p>
			<p>Our approach to every new experience can’t be waterfall process, where product makes a requirement, design gives a presentation, and dev builds something. Instead, we need to be nimble and reactive, building tangible and testable devices that improve and delight with each iteration. The only thing we can predict here is unpredictability.</p>
			<p>It’s clear that voice integration is becoming table stakes of the future. And while no one is nearing the artificial intelligence of KITT from Knight Rider, our continued focus on how voice can best serve our customers will help us get there sooner.</p>
